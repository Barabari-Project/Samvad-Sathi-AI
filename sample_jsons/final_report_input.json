  "Answer": "of, yeah, so um, one technical challenge was like, ODIA language, you know, it had, like, way less data than others, so, model was like, kind of struggling to learn it properly, I'm like, you know, the loss was, and all, loss was high and all, and um, it had, just wasn't working good, so um, we tried to, like, fix that by making batches balanced, like, you know, make sure each batch had thoda-thoda from every language, so like, even if ODIA ka data kam tha, it still came in training, I mean, it helped, kind of, but not fully, cause data hi kam tha, you know what I mean, and so, um, yeah, so, training the model itself was like, tough, it's, it's like, our first time training something this big, memory ka kaafi issue de raha tha, and GPU be limited tha, so, um, we did, like, the gradient accumulation and stuff, and processed data in chunks, like, um, small parts, so it doesn't crash or something, so, like, haan, it was kind of difficult, but, I mean, we did jugaad, and somehow trained it, and yeah, I learned a lot, but still, like, next time we can do better, you know what I mean.",

  "Answer": "Ah right, the dashboard thing... so basically, we had this, like, streaming issue where data wasn't updating live? Like, the Kafka streams were getting, uh, delayed by couple seconds sometimes, which made the charts all jumpy. I'm like, you know, it's bad for users seeing wrong numbers. So we tried, um, adding more consumer groups but that didn't fix properly. Then we did, what's it called – window aggregation? No no, watermarking! Yeah, we set event-time watermarking to handle late data, and also, like, increased the partitions. Memory issues also came up though, cause servers were like, overloaded, so we had to do vertical scaling temporarily. Ultimately it worked... ish? But honestly, I feel we could've used Flink instead maybe. Learned tons about backpressure handling anyway.",
