  "Question": "Can you elaborate on your experience with the ChatGPT 2 project? What challenges did you face when implementing the multilingual model?",
  "Answer": "of, yeah, so um, one technical challenge was like, ODIA language, you know, it had, like, way less data than others, so, model was like, kind of struggling to learn it properly, I'm like, you know, the loss was, and all, loss was high and all, and um, it had, just wasn't working good, so um, we tried to, like, fix that by making batches balanced, like, you know, make sure each batch had thoda-thoda from every language, so like, even if ODIA ka data kam tha, it still came in training, I mean, it helped, kind of, but not fully, cause data hi kam tha, you know what I mean, and so, um, yeah, so, training the model itself was like, tough, it's, it's like, our first time training something this big, memory ka kaafi issue de raha tha, and GPU be limited tha, so, um, we did, like, the gradient accumulation and stuff, and processed data in chunks, like, um, small parts, so it doesn't crash or something, so, like, haan, it was kind of difficult, but, I mean, we did jugaad, and somehow trained it, and yeah, I learned a lot, but still, like, next time we can do better, you know what I mean.",

This is excellent for clarity, but it might feel a bit too much in some areas. For example, you could try to reduce the frequency after 'help' at 00:35 to maintain flow. However, your rushed pauses at 6.9% are good, and long pauses at only 0.5% are even better. Keep up the good work with the strategy and think about pacing a little more in some spots.",
