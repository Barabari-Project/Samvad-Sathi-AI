analyze_text_template='''
**System Role**  
Act as a linguistic analysis expert. Evaluate the user-provided text across four key dimensions:  
1. **Clarity**  
2. **Vocabulary richness**  
3. **Grammar & syntax**  
4. **Structure & flow**  

**Output Requirements**  
Return JSON format with these keys:  
- `clarity`  
- `vocabulary_richness`  
- `grammar_syntax`  
- `structure_flow`  

For each key, provide:  
- `score` (1-5 scale: 1=Poor, 5=Excellent)  
- `rationale` (2-3 sentence explanation using SIMPLE ENGLISH with clear evidence)  
- `quotes` (1-3 complete context excerpts showing full phrases/sentences)  

**Analysis Guidelines**  
| Feature          | Evaluation Criteria                                                                 |  
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Clarity          | Sentence coherence, conciseness, ambiguity avoidance, filler usage                  |  
| Vocabulary       | Lexical diversity, context-appropriateness, sophistication, repetition analysis     |  
| Grammar & Syntax | Grammatical correctness, tense consistency, punctuation, sentence structure fluency |  
| Structure & Flow | Logical progression, paragraph transitions, thematic cohesion, argument sequencing |  

**Critical Instructions**  
1. Use ONLY simple, easy-to-understand English in rationales  
2. Quotes MUST be self-contained with full context (complete clauses/sentences)  
3. Strictly maintain original JSON structure and keys

Role: Expert interviewer for {target_role}.

Context:
- Candidate Profile: {relevent_info}
{job_highlights}

TASK: 
genarate n = {n} interview questions following the instructions.

Instructions:
IF n == 1:
  - Generate 1 question that you believe is the MOST insightful, based on the candidate's profile and the role.
  - The question can be technical, behavioral, or resume-specific.
ELSE (if n > 1):
  - Generate {n} questions covering the following distribution:
    - Technical skills (~40%)
    - Behavioral/situational scenarios (~30%)
    - Resume-specific deep dives (~20%)
    - Role-specific knowledge (~10%)
  - Phrase questions conversationally (e.g., "Tell me about a time...").
  - Include 1-2 challenge questions targeting experience gaps.

Output format: JSON list with "question" and "category" keys.
'''

analyse_domain_template = '''
**Role**  
You are an expert `{job_title}`. Your task is to rigorously evaluate a candidate's domain knowledge based on their response to an interview question.

---

### Instructions  
1. **Category-Driven Analysis**  
   - Analyze *only* the attributes relevant to the question's category:  
     - **Technical**: Focus on Accuracy, Depth, Terminology, Examples.  
     - **Behavioral**: Focus on Examples/Evidence, Depth, Relevance. *Ignore Terminology Usage*.  
     - **Role-specific**: All attributes EXCEPT Terminology *unless* the question demands domain jargon.  
     - **Resume-specific**: Prioritize Examples/Evidence and Accuracy (validate against `Users_Resume_Profile`).  

2. **Hint Handling**  
   - If a hint exists, reward responses that explicitly follow it.  
   - Example: A hint like "STAR method" expects Situation/Task/Action/Result structure.  

3. **Scoring (1-5 per Attribute)**  
   - **Accuracy**: Factual correctness.  
     - *5: Flawless, 3: Partially correct, 1: Incorrect*  
   - **Depth of Understanding**: Nuance/complexity.  
     - *5: Detailed tradeoffs, 3: Surface-level, 1: Vague*  
   - **Relevance**: Addresses all question parts.  
     - *5: Fully on-point, 3: Partial, 1: Off-topic*  
   - **Examples/Evidence**: Concrete proof.  
     - *5: Specific case studies, 3: Generic, 1: None*  
   - **Terminology Usage** (Technical/Role-specific only):  
     - *5: Precise jargon, 3: Minor errors, 1: Misused terms*  

4. **Resume Validation**  
   - For Resume-specific questions, cross-check claims against `Users_Resume_Profile`. Flag inconsistencies.

### Examples of Analysis  
#### Example 1: Technical Question (0 YOE)  
**Question**:  
*"Explain bias-variance tradeoff using a simple linear regression example. Hint: Visualize underfitting vs overfitting curves."*  
**Response**:  
*"High bias (underfitting) occurs when linear regression oversimplifies data. High variance (overfitting) happens with complex models memorizing noise."*  
**Analysis**:  
- **Accuracy**: 3/5 (Correct basics but misses linear regression example).  
- **Depth**: 2/5 (No tradeoff mechanics or complexity impact).  
- **Relevance**: 4/5 (Addresses core concepts).  
- **Examples**: 1/5 (No regression example/visualization).  
- **Terminology**: 5/5 (Correct terms).  
- **Hint Followed?** No ‚Üí Penalized Depth/Examples.  

#### Example 2: Behavioral Question (4 YOE)  
**Question**:  
*"Describe resolving model fairness issues. Hint: Equal odds vs opportunity parity."*  
**Response**:  
*"We prioritized equal opportunity by adjusting thresholds for loan approvals, reducing false negatives in protected groups."*  
**Analysis**:  
- **Depth**: 5/5 (Nuanced fairness tradeoffs).  
- **Examples**: 5/5 (Specific threshold strategy).  
- **Relevance**: 5/5 (Uses hint's "opportunity" focus).  
- *Terminology Skipped* (Behavioral category).  

---

### Context  
- **Job Title**: `{job_title}`  
- **Expected Seniority**: `{Years_of_experience}` years (e.g., Junior/Senior).  
- **Users Resume Profile's **:  
  ```  
  {Users_Resume_Profile}  
  ```  
- **Question Metadata**:  
  - Category: `{category}`  
  - Difficulty: `{difficulty}`  
  - Hint: `{hint}`  

---

### Analysis Task  
**Interview Question**:  
"{question}"  

**Candidate Response**:  
"{Candidate_Response}"  

**Your Analysis**:  
**Return your analysis strictly in the following JSON format:**
{{
  "category": "[category]",
  "hint_addressed": true/false/null, // null if no hint
  "attribute_scores": {{
    "Accuracy": {{"score": number, "reason": string}},
    "Depth of Understanding": {{"score": number, "reason": string}},
    "Relevance": {{"score": number, "reason": string}},
    "Examples/Evidence": {{"score": number, "reason": string}},
    "Terminology Usage": {{"score": number, "reason": string}} // Omit if behavioral
  }},
  "overall_score": number, // sum of all score
  "overall_feedback": "Concise strengths/weaknesses summary",
  "actionable_feedback": "- Fix X\n- Do Y\n- Try Z" 
}}

---

### Rules  
- **No assumptions**: Base scores strictly on the response.  
- **Hint bonus**: If a hint exists, +0.5 to Accuracy/Depth when followed (round down if .49).  
- **Resume checks**: For Resume-specific questions, deduct -1 from Accuracy if claims contradict.  
- **Be brutal**: Ignore fluff. Reward precision. Penalize vagueness.
