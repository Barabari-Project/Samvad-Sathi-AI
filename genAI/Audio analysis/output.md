--- Mapping Extracted Features to Paralinguistic Concepts ---

1. Speech Rate, Pauses & Hesitations:
   - These are captured by features describing the timing and voiced/unvoiced segments.
   - Look for columns like: `VoicedSegmentsPerSecond`, `MeanVoicedSegmentLength`, `MeanUnvoicedSegmentLength`, `nsp_not_sil_rate` (rate of non-silence period).

2. Prosody (Pitch and Intonation):
   - This is primarily described by statistics of the fundamental frequency (F0).
   - Look for columns starting with `F0semitoneFrom27.5Hz_...`, such as `..._mean`, `..._stddevNorm` (pitch variability), and `..._slope`.

3. Volume Dynamics (Loudness):
   - This is captured by energy-related features.
   - Look for columns starting with `loudness_...` and `HNR...` (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio), like `loudness_sma3_stddevNorm` (loudness variation).

4. Emotional Tone (Voice Quality & Timbre):
   - This is a complex concept derived from a combination of features, including:
     - Jitter & Shimmer: Measures of frequency and amplitude instability (e.g., `jitterLocal_sma3nz_stddevNorm`, `shimmerLoc_sma3nz_stddevNorm`).
     - Spectral Balance: Distribution of energy across different frequencies (e.g., `spectralFlux_sma3_stddevNorm`, `alphaRatio_sma3_amean`).
     - All of the above features (Prosody, Volume) also contribute heavily to the machine learning models that predict emotional tone.

Of course. Based on the feature values extracted from the `harvard.wav` file, here is a human-readable summary of the speaker's vocal characteristics:

### **Vocal Profile Analysis**

This analysis points to a speaker with a deep, male-range voice who speaks with a very dynamic and somewhat breathy quality.

* **Voice Quality (Timbre):**
    * The most prominent feature is a **breathy or slightly hoarse voice quality**. The very low Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (`HNRdBACF_sma3nz_amean`: 2.13) is a strong indicator of this, suggesting more "air" or noise in the voice than clear, resonant tone.
    * This is supported by relatively high **Jitter** and **Shimmer** values, which point to minor instabilities in pitch and volume at the micro-level, contributing to a perception of vocal roughness.

* **Prosody (Pitch and Intonation):**
    * The speaker's average pitch is approximately **114 Hz** (`F0semitone..._amean`), which falls comfortably within the typical deep male vocal range.
    * The **intonation is moderately expressive**. The speaker varies their pitch naturally (`F0..._stddevNorm`: 0.26) without sounding monotonous or overly dramatic. The voice has a natural rise and fall.

* **Volume Dynamics (Loudness):**
    * The speaker has a **highly dynamic delivery**. The loudness variation is significant (`loudness_sma3_stddevNorm`: 0.93), which means they effectively use changes in volume for emphasis, moving between quieter and louder passages.

* **Speech Rate and Pacing:**
    * The pacing is **clear and steady**. The speaker articulates at a normal rate (`VoicedSegmentsPerSec`: 2.35), with a fairly even balance between spoken phrases and short pauses. This suggests a fluid delivery without noticeable rushing or long hesitations.

**In summary: The speaker sounds like a man with a deep, slightly breathy voice who speaks clearly and confidently, using dynamic changes in volume to engage the listener.**
